Title: Justin Chiao

----

Text: Actor and director Justin Chiao and I collaborated on posters for his thesis film *«Christian et Christine»*. The result was a series of posters set in Bergman-esque black and ivory, using the gorgeous still photography taken on set as well as a small info site in the same style.
