Sidebar: I designed an entire set of print materials for (tooltip: the Los Angeles River Revitalization Corporation's show: A mouthful, I know.) annual fundraiser, including invitations, donation inserts, sponsorship posters, and the likes. When they they decided to transition away from print the following year they hired me again â€“ this time to design and develop a mini-site that managed invitations and donations for the event.
