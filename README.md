Grunt Base
===

Boilerplate architecture for Grunt projects.

### Included Plugins

A number of Grunt plugins are pre-declared, including:

1. [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)
2. [autoprefixer](https://github.com/nDmitry/grunt-autoprefixer)
3. [contrib-clean](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-clean)
4. [contrib-jshint](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jshint)
5. [contrib-nodeunit](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-nodeunit)
6. [contrib-sass](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-sass)
7. [contrib-uglify](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify)
8. [contrib-watch](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch)

These plugins are declared but are _not_ installed, The actual innards of each plugin should be installed by Node and are therefore ignored in the repository. Once you've pulled this repo down to your local machine you can install them running the following `npm install` from the command line prompt at the root of your local copy. And voila! If you have Node set up this 'lil guy should go about installing all of the necessary dependencies listed above.
